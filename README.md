# semantic-refactoring-project

This project is a refactoring of a website from a company that provides SEO and marketing services.

The focus of this project was to improve the search engine visibility and accessibility of this site.
This is hugely important in modern day web design as clients usually want sites to be accessible to users of all different abilities and conditions.

The HTML has been refactored to add semantic elements, as well as accessiblity structures such as alt tags and clear navigation.

The CSS has been optimized and consolidated to remove unnecessary lines of code, and improve the overall performance of the site.

Any significant changes have been explained in comments on the CSS, which should ensure the code is easily navigated.

This was a useful activity to see a working website and work to try and consolidate and improve the code behind it, whilst keeping all design and creative elements intact.
